This year we have reduced the amount of competitions from 6 to 4, with them being hosted at the March, June September, and December meetings. 

The winning beer from each competition will recieve 10 points, 2nd place 9 points, and so on. If we have more than 10 entries one month, we'll start with the largest number. In 2022, we never had more than 9 entrants, it is assumed that starting with 10 will be safe.

Everyone at the meeting ranked the beers 1 - 6, except the brewers who ranked them 1 - 5. Above is the total of all the brewers votes. Golf rules here, lowest score wins. It was decided last night if there was a tie, we would award the brewers that were tied the highest amount of points. For instance, Joe and Josh tied for 1st, they both get 10 points and we had a tie for 4th, they'll receive 7 points each.
