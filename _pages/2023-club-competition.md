## 2023 Club Competition

This year we have reduced the amount of competitions from 6 to 4, with them being hosted at the March, June September, and December meetings. 

The winning beer from each competition will recieve 10 points, 2nd place 9 points, and so on. If we have more than 10 entries one month, we'll start with the largest number. In 2022, we never had more than 9 entrants, it is assumed that startig with 10 will be safe.
