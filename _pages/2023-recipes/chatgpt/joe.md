Dungeon Master's Ale

Batch Size: 5.5 gallons (20.8 liters)
OG: 1.060
FG: 1.015
ABV: 6%
IBU: 40

Ingredients:

Malts:

11 lbs (5 kg) Pale Malt (2-row)
1 lb (0.45 kg) Munich Malt
12 oz (340 g) Crystal 60 Malt
8 oz (227 g) Victory Malt
4 oz (113 g) Chocolate Malt
Hops:

1 oz (28 g) Magnum hops (12% AA) - 60 minutes
1 oz (28 g) Cascade hops (5.5% AA) - 15 minutes
1 oz (28 g) Centennial hops (10% AA) - 5 minutes
1 oz (28 g) Willamette hops (5% AA) - flameout/whirlpool
Yeast:

American Ale yeast (choose a strain that complements your desired flavor profile)
Instructions:

Mash the grains:

Heat 4.75 gallons (18 liters) of water to around 162°F (72°C).
Add the crushed grains and mix well.
Maintain the mash temperature at around 152°F (67°C) for 60 minutes.
Vorlauf (recirculate) the wort until clear, then sparge with 170°F (77°C) water until you collect around 7 gallons (26.5 liters) of wort.
Boil:

Bring the wort to a rolling boil.
Add the Magnum hops and boil for 60 minutes.
Add the Cascade hops and boil for an additional 15 minutes.
Add the Centennial hops and boil for 5 more minutes.
At flameout, add the Willamette hops and let them steep for about 15 minutes before cooling.
Cool and transfer:

After the hop steeping, cool the wort rapidly to around 68°F (20°C).
Transfer the cooled wort to a sanitized fermenter.
Fermentation:

Pitch the American Ale yeast according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Ferment at a temperature between 65-70°F (18-21°C) for about 2 weeks or until fermentation activity subsides.
Once fermentation is complete, you can consider dry hopping for added aroma if desired (optional).
Bottling:

Prime with an appropriate amount of priming sugar for your desired carbonation level.
Bottle the beer and let it carbonate for about 2 weeks at room temperature.
Chill the bottles for a few days in the refrigerator before enjoying.
This Dungeon Master's Ale will have a nice balance of maltiness and hop character, making it a great companion for your gaming session. Cheers!
